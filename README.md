## CSGO Onion project

Made this couple years ago, the sigs might be outdated + I remember I was using one offset which would need to be updated as well.

The code formatting (splitting into files, etc) is shit, but the code should be workable.

I spent quite a lot of time on making the aimbot decent (human settings - does smooth, aim on curve, overaim and snap back to target)

The hack is controlled using numpad and out is shown in console, find the keys in code.
